made a docker file 3am 2018-03-10 Sat 02:53 AM

I love this ctrld thing

I'll populate it later, I have the correct shit installed

todo:

1) fill out wsgi file
2) get kink.go file to return "hello world" to nginx
3) get kink.go to run kinkapp.go, and return "hello world" to nginx
4) get kinkapp.go to return a page based on a jinja2 template, that says hello world
5) get kinkapp to return a page that has a string, a textbox, and a button
   the textbox takes a string, the button sends it to the database, the string
   shows the new database string entry
6) get kinkapp to return a js page
7) make angular js blog post page
8) make angular js blog entry page
9) make angular js landing page
10) angular shop
