so this is my golang website

2018-03-14 Wed 10:31 PM

decided to use revel for the backend

decided to use angular 2/5 for the frontend

started using atom, I will definitely use it for golang

started using atom for angular and then I found out that
angular has a special IDE

so getting that installed was impossible

and then importing the angular project that I created was impossible

but finally I got it imported, and as I was looking through the
list of node_modules I found that amqplib is installed by default.

so rabbitmq was built in by default for some reason.
